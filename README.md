_**Summary:**_ ComicCol is an application that allows users to search and add their favorite comics to a list where they can rate and review them. The ComicVine API is used to collect the data of comics in order to give the users a wide varity of comics. Some of this information includes a description, title, name of issue, and data released. While reading the information on a comic the user is able to leave a review at the bottom of the page. This application UI is easy to navigate and has a beautiful fron end UI. Each page is easy on the eyes and fits our comic theme.
